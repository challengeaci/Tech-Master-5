Agricultural Crop Prediction

Use of python libraries for machine Learning Algorithmss
Libraries or dependencies used are 
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Django.

We have used to algorithms to better analyse the date that are Random forest and SVM algorithms.
First you have to train the data using the agrisvm.py script where the SVM is used for better predictability.Then you have to give inputs for the conditions available and the machine will give you an output for the ideal crop to be grown.
Solidity Online Editor is used for writing the smart contract to be integrted on Ethereum Network. Dependencies that are involved are node-js and ethereum/web3.js
